I want you to try and pick out what is unusual about this paragraph.
How quickly you find out what is so unusual about it is an indication
of your ability to think in a way that shows off your smarts.
I know that at first this paragraph looks ordinary, and you probably
think that nothing is wrong with it. In fact, nothing is wrong with it,
but it is unusual. Just study it long and hard, and you will know that
which you first cannont hit upon. Think about it, and do it without any
coaching. I know that your brain can find a way to get it right. so
work hard to try to figure it out and stay cool throughout this task.
Good luck.
